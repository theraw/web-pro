# web-pro

This script will automatically install Nginx plus + php 7.3 on your Ubuntu 20.04 x86_64 servers. 

Well that's just it for now!


This is more of a personal setup actually well i run everything on docker containers so i can easly scale whatever it is 
there's a small problem like you won't be able to execute contab by cli on your container where your web is running because 
there's no php but is remote php https://github.com/theraw/web-pro/blob/master/docker/personal-host.yml#L20
